Find the name of the official Ubuntu image in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search)

Run a container with this image interactively (Hint: [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/))

Verify inside the container that you are in a Ubuntu environment using `cat /etc/os-release` and copy the content of that file to `/root/os-release.txt`.

Exit the container
